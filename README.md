# SubStringSearch
This Angular app is a way to search through strings of text for occurences of a substring of text.

Enter the main text to be searched and the substring to search for then press submit.
Blank strings and string of 1,2 or 3 full stops do not work.

Notes: 
The app is a single page application with an asp.net backend.
The page communicates with a very simple http.get.
I tried to keep the thing as lightweight as possible so apologies for the blandness.
I'm still working on the mocking of http requests for the unit tests.
